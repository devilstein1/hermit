### 🚀 Overview

**Hermit** is the most powerful Python obfuscation engine, developed by **Stein**  
🔗 https://t.me/rejerk

Hermit makes your Python code virtually impossible to be retrieved back to its original form.

It is designed to run on most major platforms:

- 🖥️ Windows  
- 📱 ARMv7  
- 📱 ARMv8  

---

### 📦 Dependencies

To make the code work properly, all required dependencies must be installed.

The obfuscator runs **only on Termux**, while the obfuscated output runs on **ARMv7, ARMv8, and Windows**.

### 🛠️ Installation (Termux Only)

pkg upgrade  
pkg install git -y  
pkg install python -y
